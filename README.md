# ThermalVideo_miniproject_task
## TASK
Use OpenCV with the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWS2MoFphHwTwblN82QZZbYqEmycN0Jj/view?usp=sharing) provided to find components(4 or 8 connected components) in the video that have a frequency of 0-1 Hz. 
## Attempt
My code for this task is in task_codes.ipynb in task folder of this repository
## Software Requirements
I have used the following versions for this mini-project: python 3.12.0, matplotlib==3.8.3, numpy==1.26.3, opencv-python==4.9.0.80
## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Nipun Batra for this opportunity. I also wish to thank the project lead, Mr. Rishiraj Adhikary, for responding to all my queries and giving me helpful advice and suggestions. These tasks motivated me to learn more about image processing.
